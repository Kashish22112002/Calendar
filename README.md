# Calendar
EXPLANATION-

This program is used to print the 12 -month calendar or the desired calendar using zeller’s algorithm with the correct date and month.
A pop up line would appear asking the user for “entering the desired year” 
For eg: let’s say that we put 2003 into it and press enter
Thereafter we can see the entire yearly calendar of the year 2003 . 

ZELLER’S ALGORITHM
 d = (year - 1) * 365) + ((year - 1) / 4) - ((year - 1) / 100) + ((year) / 400) + 1) % 7
 Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm devised by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. It can be considered to be based on the conversion between Julian day and the calendar date. 
It is an algorithm to find the day of the week for any date.
